## Characters

# Gameplay

## Gameplay Hook

Travel as far as possible, collect coins, and avoid hazards such as zappers, missiles and high-intensity laser beams.

When the player presses anywhere on the touchscreen, the jetpack fires and Barry rises.
When the player lets go, the jetpack turns off, and Barry falls.

Because he is continually in motion, the player does not control his speed, simply his movement along the vertical axis.

## Loops

Travel as far as you can without dying.
When you die you can play again to beat the highest score and use bonuses from previous games.

## Entities

Obstacles in the game are zappers, missiles and high-intensity laser beams.

## Progression

Run endlessly from left to right while the speed increases.
The score increments by the distance you travel and the goal is to get the highest score possible.

## Losing

Contact with any of obstacles results in loosing a life and then death.
Barry's body will tumble and slide for an additional distance upon dying.

At the end of each run, these spin tokens are used in a slot machine (one token gives one spin) which can award the player various prizes, including coins, additional spin tokens, a head-start, a player revival, and explosives that can propel the player's body for an additional distance after death.

# Assets
