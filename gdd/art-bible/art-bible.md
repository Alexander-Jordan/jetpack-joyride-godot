# Art Style

## General

The art style will be as close to the original as possible, with some small adjustments to keep the scope down. It might even reuse the existing artwork.

I will also try to get my nephew in somehow, maybe as the main character. Could maybe be done by modifying the original character.

# Environments

In the original the laboratory changes from the typical laboritory rooms to some greenary, caves, or water parts.

But to keep the scope down this remake is only going to have the laboritory rooms included.

It could include some blinking lights, signs and desks/computers.
